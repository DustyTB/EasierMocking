# Easier Mocking
Do you want to mock people but are too lazy to turn caps-lock on/off every second key press? Well worry not, with my tool here we can convert an entire paragraph to a mocking paragraph. Lets say you don't want to convert, thanks to my (nonexistent) creativity - theres a toggle option to make the computer do the caps-lock labor for you!

How useful! 

### Build Requirements
